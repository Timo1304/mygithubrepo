This is a react project where i implemented an API fetch of my GitHub portfolio

###

It will show a page with a list of 4 repos out of my repositories on GitHub, so i have initiated pagination to take you to other pages.

###

I have created another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the page showing my repos using nested routes.

###

Icons used in this project are from React-icons

###

I have Implemented an Error Boundary (show a page to test the error boundary) and 404 pages.

###

It's a responsive design with hambuggers menu when opened on a smaller view port

###

The GitHub logo standing alone in the home-page will take viewers to my GitHub profile.
